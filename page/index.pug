    p SpriteSpin is a jQuery plugin that turns image frames into animations. It requires an array of images or a stiched sprite sheet and plays them frame by frame like a flip book. The aim of this plugin is to provide a 360 degree view of any kind of product.
    p The plugin is built with extensibility in mind and allows web developers to customize the behavior and presentation of the animations.

    #spritespin-preview
    script(type='text/javascript' src='/release/spritespin.js')
    script(type='text/javascript').
      SpriteSpin.spritespin('#spritespin-preview', {
        source: SpriteSpin.sourceArray('http://spritespin.ginie.eu/images/rad_zoom_{frame}.jpg', { frame: [1,34], digits: 3 }),
        sense: -1
      })
